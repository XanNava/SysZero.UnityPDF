    Go into UnityHub and go to Installed editors. There will be a drop down on your version of Unity, select open in explorer. From there go to Editor

Windows: C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\<Unity Version>\Editor\Data\Managed
Mac: /Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/<Unity Version>/Unity.app/Contents/Managed

In your IDE add the reference to
